myRetail application developed using React.js

To start project download files and run npm install

After node modules have been installed npm start should get the application up and running on a local host.

For this Case Study I decided to dive into React.js and learn a new framework.

My previous experience in JavaScript Frameworks has been with mainly with Angular, but I found this to be a good reason to take a look at one of the more popular Frameworks out there.

The differences between other frameworks were noticeable and exciting to work with.

If there are any questions at all or you are interested in my thinking while developing this, feel free to email or call.

Thank you!
